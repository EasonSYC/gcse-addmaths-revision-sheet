 Knowledge Cheat Sheet for CIE IGCSE Additional Mathematics.

 Mathematics is one of my favourite subjects and it is very important whatever you are doing in the future. It is mostly about techniques for solving problems, but the knowledge behind all those techniques is vital for understanding. To aid practice, I produced this document based on the syllabus.

 This is more of an extension of the syllabus and the structure is the same. However, it provides some sample answers for those questions in the syllabus and is a good way to refer to your self-assessment based on the syllabus.

 I am also an IGCSE student so errors are inevitable in this document. Feel free to email me to point out any mistakes or submit an issue on the GitHub page!

 This document assumes prior knowledge of CIE IGCSE Mathematics.
